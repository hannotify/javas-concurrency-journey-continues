How will these features change your day-to-day life?
That depends on what kind of Java developer you are:

* Developer (Framework or Library)
* Developer (Jakarta EE)
* Developer (Spring)
* Developer (Quarkus)
* Developer Advocate / Trainer

## Developer (framework or library)



TODO: 

- framework/library developers can try out these features, but keep in mind they are currently in preview.
- Refer to the web framework example from <https://openjdk.org/jeps/446>.


note:

## Preview status

Ensures that features are "done right" before they become final and permanent parts of the language by providing a suitable window of time in which features can be improved based on user feedback.

* fully specified and implemented
* impermanent
* provoke developer feedback based on real world use
* may lead to it becoming permanent (but can in theory also be removed in the end)
