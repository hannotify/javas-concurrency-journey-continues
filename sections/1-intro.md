Hi, my name is Hanno. 
From the Netherlands, and I work at Info Support as an IT consultant.
I'm a Java Champion and an Oracle ACE.
I am @hannotify on Twitter, Mastodon or Bluesky.
(It'll always be called Twitter to me)
(About the handle: get notified of everything Hanno does. I thought it was rather clever - my wife disagrees with me though, she thinks I'm an major geek!)
I post about things I like, as everyone does I suppose.
Java Development, Version Control, Sustainability and making music.
If you're into that stuff, by all means give me a follow!

TODO: move this part to later in the talk
TODO: also add JC logo to the title slide
